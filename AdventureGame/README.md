# Overview

This is an Adventure Game Program. I created this to demonstrate the use of the C# language, Visual Studio Code, and GitHub together. 

This software starts with a menu screen. From there the user is able to pick a pirate adventure, a fantasy adventure, or have the program pick a random adventure for them. 

The appropriate class is called, and the user then goes throughout the game, entering numbers to make decisions. This program is intended to show the use of variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, methods, classes, and randomization.
